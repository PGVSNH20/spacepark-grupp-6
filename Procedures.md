## Team

The team consist of 3 to 5 persons (two buddy groups), see PingPong.

## Code review/pull request

At the end of the project will we do at least one [pull request](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/reviewing-pull-requests), each should be reviewed by two other teams.

Make sure to use code reviews. The best is to collect code reviews by functionality. So when you have some functionality ready send it for code review to the other two teams.

When your team receives a code review make sure to perform is as soon as possible, but you should not throw everything you are working on just to do the review.
